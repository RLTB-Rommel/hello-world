# Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to design, write, and execute a basic software program using Node.js. As a software engineer, my goal is to strengthen my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, runtime environments, and how to execute scripts outside the browser. This exercise helped me reinforce the concepts of console-based output, syntax correctness, and file execution through the terminal.

The software is a simple program that prints a personalized greeting:
“Hello World! Hello, Rommel!”
It serves as an introduction to coding execution and syntax familiarity, showing how Node.js can run lightweight scripts directly from the command line.

The purpose of creating this software is to apply the foundational principles of programming and ensure that my local development environment is properly set up for future projects that will build on this base.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I developed the program using Visual Studio Code as my text editor and executed it using the Node.js runtime environment. The folder includes a single .js file containing the source code and a README.md file for documentation.

Tools Used:

Visual Studio Code

Node.js

Git and GitHub for version control

Programming Language:

JavaScript (ES6 syntax)
